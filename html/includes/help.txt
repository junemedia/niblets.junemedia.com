6.  <b>Is this offer still valid </b>- all offers presented by MyFree.com are tested prior to sending out our newsletters or placement on our website.  At times, an advertiser may discontinue an offer after our testing and without notice due to their change in marketing objectives, response from readers and other factors.  We apologize for any inconvenience, and know you will find other offers you will enjoy.
