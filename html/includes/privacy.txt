marketing from us, or any of our partner Sites, via e-mail, via third party

to: a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>We
will also use your Personal Information for customer service, to provide you
with information that you may request, to customize your experience on a Site,
and to contact you when necessary in connection with transactions entered into
by you on a Site. We may also use your Personal Information for internal
business purposes, such as analyzing and managing our business. We may also
combine the information we have gathered about you with information from other
sources. We may use third parties to help us operate our business and the Sites
or administer activities on our behalf. We also reserve the right to release
current or past user information in the event that we believe that the user is
using, or has used, our services in violation of the terms and conditions, to
commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if we are sold or
acquired, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate including, without
limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third parties for
suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended

(the “Rule”). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed at the
Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you
via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule. You may unsubscribe from any of
our e-mail marketing programs at any time. In every e-mail communication we
send, there is an unsubscribe hyperlink that allows the recipient to unsubscribe
from the specific marketing program by simply clicking the hyperlink provided
and following the instructions that follow. We attempt to process all
unsubscribe requests in a prompt fashion. However, after unsubscribing, we
cannot guarantee that you will never receive another mailing from us, because
we may obtain your e-mail address in the future through a different e-mail
marketing program that you have opted into. We can guarantee, however, that if
you should ever receive another e-mail communication from us, you will be able
to remove your e-mail address via the unsubscribe hyperlink. We are able to
offer our free services, in part, based upon the willingness of our users to be
contacted by our marketing partners, including affiliated third party advertisers.
By allowing us to make the information you supply available to our marketing
partners, you will receive free product and service information that may be of
interest to you. You may, at any time, notify us that you do not wish to have
your Personal Information disclosed to third parties for offers and promotions

<p class=MsoBodyText2>We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users'
information. When users submit information at the Sites, their information is
protected both online and off-line. The privacy of your personal information is
very important to us. The servers that we store personally identifiable
information in are kept in a secure physical environment. We have security
measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of personal
information under our control. Currently, we use Secure Socket Layer Software (SSL)
to protect data and secure any transactions on some but not all of our web
sites. SSL encrypts information, including credit card numbers, names and
addresses as they are transmitted over the Internet. Please be advised that,
although we take every reasonable technological precaution available to protect
your data, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. Therefore, we cannot warrant that your information will be absolutely
secure. Any transmission of data at or through our Site is at your own risk.
However, access to your information is strictly limited, and not accessible to
the public. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of
all user information. Users under eighteen (18) years of age are not allowed to
participate in sweepstakes or game promotions that we offer. No information
should be submitted to, or posted at, any Site by visitors under eighteen (18)
years of age without the prior consent of their parent or guardian.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, children thirteen (13) years of age and younger
are not permitted to access the Sites and we do not knowingly collect Personal
Information from such children. We encourage parents and guardians to spend
time online with their children and to participate and monitor the interactive
activities of their children.</p>
